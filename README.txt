This is my first coding project. And since I study maths, this is all about prime numbers. I want to definde set that that contains all prime numbers, then a set with all numbers out of N, but without the prime numbers, then see which numbers are prime in this new set. Let's call it the prime numbers second degree. My goals are (A) to input any degree and get the set, and (B) to perform this over every possible input set.
