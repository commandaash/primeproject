This is my first coding project. Since I study maths, and since I need something to train code on, this here is a simple prime machine but more maybe than one could expect.  Because it will produce any numbers that are prime to a given set. And moe: beyond that it can define a set with all numbers minus the prime numbers already taken, then finding the next round of prime numbers in that set, i.e. second degree prime numbers. My goals are (A) to input any degree and get the prime set, and (B) to perform this over every possible input set.
